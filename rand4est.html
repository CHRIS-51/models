<p>
Training and testing data were downloaded from cloudfront. At first,
I used all data fields. Reason: in general, it is bad to throw
away data before you know or suspect it's erroneous.
</p>
Models were chosen randomly from
http://topepo.github.io/caret/modelList.html All trials done with
default settings
<br>
Trial #1: glm and ada failed: they are limited to 2-class outcomes (per the errors). 
<br>
Trial #2: lda accuracy: 42%. pls accuracy: 36%
<br>
Trial #3: rpart accuracy: 58.34%. rpart2 accuracy: 64.53%
<br>
Trial #4: treebag ran all night and froze my machine (2006 iMAC 8GB 2.66MHz Intel Core 2 Duo)
<p>
The data showed many NA and missing fields. No imputation was done;
we have no way of knowing if the data were lost or were intentionally
never measured. Removed columns using is.na() and nearZeroVar();
columns with small variance. I also removed the first 8 columns
(time, name etc); they were not measurements that depended on an
exercise. This left 52 measurements plus the classe column. To
preserve variance, no additional scaling or centering was done.
<p>
Trial #5: treebag accuracy: 99.97% and 100% on various runs
<br>
Trial #6: rf accuracy: returned 100% on 60% (train) of the data and 99.77% on the other 40% (validate)
<br>
Trial #7: nb (naive bayes) accuracy: 76.38% on the same 60/40 split
<br>
Trial #8: rf accuracy: 99.4% on the training set with a 50/50 split and seed set to 4444.
<br>
Trial #9: rf accuracy: <B>99.18%</B> on the training set with a 70/30 split and seed set to 4444.
<br>
Trial #10: treebag accuracy: 98.71% on the training set with a 70/30 split and seed set to 883388.
<p>
Ran explicit cross-validation by applying this control to my training:
trainControl(method="cv", number=3) (although rf does this by
default) to quantify error, which gave an out of sample error of
0.0075 (1-.9925). Given only 5 categories and almost 20000 examples,
one might suspect overfitting, but this has been accounted for in the model.
<p>
Applying the rf and treebag models to the test dataset, I predicted 20/20 classes correctly.
